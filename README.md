# Hobbyist Info Sharing System

This is a simple system that allows the user to register/login as a member and manage their profiles (CRUD). The system also allows the user to manage their hobbies (CRUD). Then, there is a sharing page which is more like a social media feed where the current user can view other user's shared hobbies. All of code is implemented using Data Structures in order to learn more about them.

> Note: This system does not have a database.
